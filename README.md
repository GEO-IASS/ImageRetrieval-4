# MATLAB code for local directory based image-retrieval
Place the code in a directory where all the image files are located. Pick an image number as query image. 
The code would return two closest matches based on the calculation of euclidean distance between feature vectors of the images. 
Code developed by Siddharth Ravi, Kes Cassee and Dave Verstrate.
